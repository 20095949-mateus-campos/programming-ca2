This repository contains an "Industrial ERP Information System" Flask + React web application developed for my Programming for Information Systems CA 2 at Dublin Business School - MSc in Information Systems with Computing, Year 1, Semester 1.

## Part 1: Requirements and Setup

## Part 2: System Requirements and Design

## Part 3: Proof of Concept

Following the plan established in the previous section, a prototype was developed for the manufacturing module of the ERP system under consideration.

The below is a breakdown of the project’s file structure:

The following are some screenshots of the application in use showcasing CRUD operations for the Product entity (other entities are analogous):

| ![home.png](screenshots/home.png) | ![read_all.png](screenshots/read_all.png) |
| :-: | :-: |
| *Home view* | *Read products* |  

| ![create.png](screenshots/create.png) | ![read.png](screenshots/read.png) |
| :-: | :-: |
| *Create product* | *Read product* |  

| ![update.png](screenshots/update.png) | ![delete.png](screenshots/delete.png) |
| :-: | :-: |
| *Update product* | *Delete products* |
